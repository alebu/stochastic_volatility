\chapter{Review of probability calculus}\label{apx:prob}

Use appendicies only for material that is directly relevant to the contents of your dissertation and is referenced from within it.  Never use it for code or for things that you found interesting, but did not in the end use for your own work.  If you and your supervisor agree that providing examiners with code is essential then please deposit it online (via a service such as GitHub).

\chapter{Research Ethics Approval}\label{apx:ethics}

The last appendix of the dissertation must contain evidence that you complied with the University of Sheffield research ethics approval process. Like all other appendices, it should be cross-referenced from the main text of the dissertation so that readers are alerted to its presence. The appendix should start with a paragraph of text, in your own words, that summarises the approval process as it applied to your dissertation. Here is an example to get you started.

The research ethics approval process for the work described in this dissertation was completed in March 2019, before any work using data commenced. Due to the use of data arising from <summarise the data collection process here>, formal research ethics approval was deemed to be necessary and, when submitted, the application was allocated reference number: 000094. Formal approval is evidenced here by inclusion of the final approval letter in Figure~\ref{ethicsapprov}.
