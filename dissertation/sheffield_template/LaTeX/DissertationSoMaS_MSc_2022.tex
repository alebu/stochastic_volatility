\chapter{Introduction}\label{intro}
You can call your first chapter (and all the others) whatever you wish, but it is usual to start with an introduction to your project and, perhaps, a discussion of some background literature.

When you are discussing other people's work, you might find the following snippets of \LaTeX\ helpful.  You might make references like these if you want to discuss the work of \citet{lambert} and \citet{dellas} within a sentence. Then, later, you might also want to make some parenthetic references to support an argument that you are making, like this \citep{lambert}.  Alternatively, we might want to say that in \citeyear{lambert} a key paper was published by \citeauthor{lambert} in which they demonstrated that ...

In the next chapter, we provide some more snippets that you might find useful.  We do not give advice about the structure of the dissertation here, since that is covered in the separate document on Dissertation Expectations (on Blackboard), but do remember the very strict page limit of 70 pages in the \verb+\mainmatter+ of your dissertation. Those working on theoretical topics, with little need for figures and tables in their dissertation, should aim for considerably fewer than 70 pages (typically 30--50).  If you do submit something longer, examiners will read only the first 70 pages (or 50  pages of more theoretical material).  Note too that, regardless of length, any material in appendices will only be inspected cursorily by examiners. You should thus use appendices judiciously.


\chapter{Some reminders}\label{reminders}

For all the basics of typesetting, that you are likely to need in your dissertation, please use the handouts on \LaTeX\ that you were given earlier in the MSc or consult or the single document on \LaTeX\ provided on the dissertation Blackboard page.  Below we provide further snippets of code, inspired by the Wikipedia entry on L\'{e}vy's continuity theorem, to remind you of some key typesetting concepts that you should be aware of.

Before we do that, however, just a quick note on editing and commenting on your writing. First, you might find the online \LaTeX\ editor called Overleaf helpful for working on your dissertation and sharing it with your Support Worker. Instructions for using Overleaf in this way are provided on Blackboard. Second, note that we have defined some extra \LaTeX\ commands within this template to help when discussing your writing with others. You are not required to use these commands, but we hope that you (and the staff working with you) might find them useful.

\section{A key theorem}\label{theorem}

Later we will find it useful to remember L\'{e}vy's continuity theorem (Theorem~\ref{theorem:levyct}), which we do not prove since it is fairly well known, but complete proofs are available in \citet[section 18.1]{Williams} and \citet[Theorems 14.15 and 18.21]{Fristedt}.


\begin{theorem}\label{theorem:levyct}
 Suppose we have
\begin{itemize}
\item a sequence of random variables $\{X_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$, not necessarily sharing a common probability space,
\item the sequence of corresponding characteristic functions $\{\varphi_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$, which by definition are:
$$
\varphi_n(t) = \E e^{itX_n} \quad \forall t\in\mathbb{R},\ \forall n\in\mathbb{N},
$$
where $\E$ is the expected value operator.
\end{itemize}
If the sequence of characteristic functions converges pointwise to some function~$\varphi$ where
$$\varphi_n(t)\to\varphi(t) \quad \forall t\in\mathbb{R},$$
then the following statements become equivalent:
\begin{itemize}
\item $X_n$ converges in distribution to some random variable $X$:
$$X_n\ \xrightarrow{\mathcal D}\ X,$$
i.e.\ the cumulative distribution functions corresponding to random variables converge at every continuity point of the c.d.f.\ of $X$;
\item $\{X_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$is tight:
$$\lim_{x\to\infty}\left( \sup_n \Prob\big[\, |X_n|>x \,\big]\right) = 0;$$
\item $\varphi(t)$ is a characteristic function of some random variable $X$;
\item $\varphi(t)$ is a continuous function of $t$;
\item $\varphi(t)$ is continuous at $t=0$.
\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\section{Another section}

It is often useful to refer the reader to a figure, such as Figure~\ref{Fig:Rwalk}, and you could use a similar \verb+\label+ and \verb+\ref+ technique for refering to chapters (such as Chapter~\ref{intro}), sections (such as Section~\ref{theorem}), Appendices (like Appendices~\ref{apx:prob}, \ref{apx:proofs} and \ref{apx:ethics}), as well as for tables.
